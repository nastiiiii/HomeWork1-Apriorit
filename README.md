Factory method.
Implement a console application that:
- gets the full path to the folder in the input parameter
- collects a list of files and folders that are in this folder (you can implement recursively if you have time and inspiration, or non-recursively), also collects their properties such as size, creation time, modification time, last access time, type, read-only, archived, etc., at least 3 properties (at your choice).
- prints a "report" on the contents of the folder in the following formats: txt, csv, xml, json (select not
less than two). The word "format" means not only the file extension, but also its contents.
- use the factory method to print the report
